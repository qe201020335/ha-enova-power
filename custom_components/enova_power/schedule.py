# portal's per-day total_on/mid/off_peak exactly, and the DST transition days
# carry the local-clock signatures (the spring-forward day zeroes the skipped
# hour's slot; the fall-back day lumps the repeated hour). An earlier fixed-EST
# interpretation classified identically by label value but put summer
# timestamps one hour late.
