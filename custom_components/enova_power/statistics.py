"""Import Enova Power usage into Home Assistant long-term statistics.

Energy data is historical and lagged, so it belongs in external statistics (not
a live sensor): this backfills the Energy dashboard with real history.

All series are **hourly** — the source's own resolution (the portal publishes
``h01``–``h24`` per day) and the finest granularity long-term statistics can
hold — so hourly charts attribute buckets and costs to the hours the energy
was used. ``STATS_VERSION`` tracks this format (and, as of v5, forces a
one-time repair of already-stored series; see below).

Buckets are **usage classifications**, computed from the hourly intervals by
local Ontario wall-clock time (verified to match the portal's own TOU totals —
see ``schedule.period_for_interval``). All plan schemes are classified for every
account (plan-independent), so a plan change never orphans a bucket; only the
active ``energy_cost`` series changes which rates it applies. Cost is the energy
line item only (excludes delivery, regulatory charges, rebates and tax); the
actual all-in bill is surfaced separately as ``last_bill_amount``. The portal
only exposes *current* rates (querying a past range still returns today's
rates), so cost applies the current rates/threshold to all history — an
approximation that self-corrects going forward as rates update on May 1 / Nov 1.

Each kWh bucket also gets a paired **cost series** (``cost_<bucket>_<meter>``),
priced at its scheme's current rates, so buckets can be tracked with costs in
the Energy dashboard; a scheme's bucket costs sum to its ``cost_if_*`` series.

External statistics carry an absolute cumulative ``sum``. Every series of a
meter shares one **download window** — the coordinator's ``[from_date, today]``
as UTC hour bounds — and the set of **covered days** (local dates the download
returned with at least one published hour). When the window overlaps rows
already stored, the import **anchors, merges and rewrites**: it anchors on the
last stored row *before* the window, then re-derives one continuous chain over
the stored rows from the window on and the new points (``_merge_statistics``):
new points replace stored hours; a stored in-window hour on a covered day that
the download no longer carries becomes a zero increment (so a revised tier
split or a revised preliminary day can't leave stale plateaus behind); stored
hours on uncovered days and rows after the window keep their stored increments,
re-based on the new chain. This is idempotent when nothing changed, and it
heals the portal's publication pattern — a day first appears as a preliminary
row with the whole total in the first hour slot and explicit zeros elsewhere,
then gets revised to real hourly values a day later. History older than the
window is never touched; a series added by an upgrade still can't backfill on
its own — ``expected_statistic_ids`` + ``async_missing_series`` let the
coordinator detect that case and refetch full history once.

The same pre-write read doubles as an **integrity check**: a cumulative sum
must never fall, so ``find_sum_drops`` over the anchor plus the stored rows
reports every hour whose sum is below its predecessor's. ``async_import_meter``
returns those per series (``ImportResult.broken``) and ``async_scan_series``
runs the check over a series' full history once at startup; the coordinator
heals a broken meter by re-importing it from its oldest stored date — the same
in-place merge-and-check import used for every other cycle, no clear involved.
``STATS_VERSION`` triggers that heal unconditionally once per entry: bumping it
makes the coordinator's first refresh treat every meter as broken regardless of
what the check finds, repairing whatever shape the previous version left behind
(daily granularity, misclassified summer hours, or a corrupted sum) from the
meter's oldest stored date. There is no separate rebuild path any more — imports
are still forward-only in the sense that they never invent history the portal
doesn't return, but a version bump no longer needs one, because the merge
already rewrites any window in place.
