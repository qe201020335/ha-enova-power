"""Data update coordinator for Enova Power.

Each cycle fetches usage per meter and imports it into Home Assistant long-term
statistics. The download window is derived from the recorder (no in-memory flag):
with no prior statistics it backfills ``BACKFILL_MONTHS`` of history once, and
thereafter fetches incrementally but always covers the current billing cycle so
cycle-to-date totals are correct. Plans are resolved per meter (a subscriber can
be on different plans per meter); an account-wide options value overrides
detection. The coordinator's ``data`` maps each meter id to its ``MeterData``.
